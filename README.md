# Exercise 1: Image Filtering and Object Identification

In this exercise we will first familiarise yourself with basic the image filtering routines of Python and NumPy
(Question 1), then develop a simple image querying system which accepts a query image as input and then
finds a set of similar images in the database (Question 2, 3 and 4).
